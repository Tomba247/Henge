/// A surface that works like a Mac's trackpad: the engine presents it on
/// the Mac's USB bus as a Magic Trackpad 2, so the Mac's own multitouch engine sees
/// the fingers: two scroll, three swipe between Spaces and to Mission Control, four
/// show the session's hidden controls. Every contact is forwarded to the emulated
/// pad exactly as it arrives, in both input modes; nothing below changes that.
///
/// Clicking depends on the input mode (Settings > Trackpad):
///  - Touchscreen: the surface itself clicks, through the click language in
///    GestureEngine (GestureEngine.swift). A quick tap is a left click. A press
///    held still is a right click: the secondary button goes down when the hold
///    threshold passes and up when the finger lifts. A double tap whose second
///    press is held is a grab: the primary button goes down on the second press
///    itself and up at lift, so moving drags. These go out as mouse buttons
///    alongside the forwarded contacts; the contacts keep owning pointer motion,
///    so the engine's own motion actions are never executed here. Two or more
///    fingers produce no app-side buttons at all: the forwarded contacts carry
///    the gesture and the guest's trackpad driver owns the result, including
///    scrolling.
///  - Volume buttons: the surface only points and gestures; the clicks live on the
///    volume keys (VolumeClicks), so a tap here does nothing, and the gesture
///    engine never runs.
/// Only fingers count: a real trackpad or mouse goes through HardwareMouse.
